Whispers of the Wind

The wind whispers secrets through the trees,
A melody carried on the gentle breeze.
It tells of stars, of skies so vast,
Of moments fleeting, never meant to last.

Leaves dance softly in its embrace,
Each one a story, a memory, a trace.
And as the day fades to twilightâ€™s end,
The wind is the keeper, the silent friend.
